# Coding-Challenges

A personal repo as I endeavor to do daily coding challenges in JavaScript (and later include Go, Python and Java)! 

Problems are located on `master` and solutions are located in the `solutions` branch.

Coding challenges in this repo are courtesy of:

### Coding resources:

__Algorithms__
- [Time Complexity Wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
- [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)

__Data Structures__
- [Linked Lists Basics](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf) by Nick Parlante



### To-do:

- Create tests on solutions branch
- Add more resources



### Contact
My solutions are not the best, but I am always looking to optimize (or find a clever solution :ghost:).
If you have any suggestions (especially for resources!), please email me @ [piccola.lupina@gmail.com](piccola.lupina@gmail.com)
